## Boosting (Breakable Objects)

### Overview

- Once a Breakable item falls so far onto a surface it will break into pieces that we call 'Particles'.
- These particles have vertical and horizontal collision.
- 47 can stand on and be pushed by these particles.
- The main use for these particles is gaining height, whether it is a small or a large amount.
- The more amount of particles a (Breakable Object) has the higher you get from boosting off that (Breakable Object).
- For the most amount of height you can walk over the explosion of the breakable object as its breaking.
- If you pass over the (Breakable Object) as its breaking AND get good RNG on the breakable pattern you can get a 'Double boost' off that item and gain extra height again.
- How fast you fall down after boosting into the air / fall after boosting over a stair railing etc. is determined by FPS (faster FPS = faster fall)

### List of Viable Boosting Items

- Violin (Most amount, generates the most height and the easiest to stand on)
- Crystal Ball / Stone bust (High amount, never really useful though)
- Muffin / Brick (Moderate amount, best for staircases with normal railings)
- Apple (Least amount, not good for anything but can work)

- Soap
- Apricot

### General Tips

- If throwing breakable objects to boost, it may be helpful to fast throw (crouch -> throw) to throw faster and save time.
  - [Example](https://youtu.be/syuwT2Ce01M?t=61)
- Aiming with the gun can help a lot navigating out of bounds, as you move with greater precision when aiming a run.

**Note that 47 does not take fall damage in general, but in certain areas of the map, such as over water, you can fall through a kill plane and instantly die.**

### Boost Examples (no Breaching Charge)

**Generally speaking, most non-breaching charge boosts can be practiced to be highly consistent, and are viable for full game.**

#### Chair Boost

- [Paris Chair Boost](https://youtu.be/oNCi8t4rjtM?t=57): Throw as shown. It may be helpful to strafe + slightly aim in with pistol.

#### Stair Boost

- [Chongqing Stair Boost](https://youtu.be/dh8IuU2kTho?t=33): Throw breakable brick to get onto stair railings
- [Sgail Stair Boost](https://youtu.be/3LJ_Bffotwg?t=610): Throw muffin to get onto stair railings, use pistol aiming to move precisely after that.
- Additional tips: Throw breakable object about as far away from the side and the width of 47's feet and on the 1st step. If you throw the breakable object on the corner of the step or the edge of the step it may not break. Try to make sure that you get a circle emanating from where the muffin throw reticle is, for most consistency.

- Checking for circle when throwing breakable object

#### Boost with Briefcase (no Breaching Charge)

- [Colorado Boost with Suitcase](https://youtu.be/264oMY9Ys34?t=60): Throw breakable crystal ball to walk on briefcase and get a better sniping angle

#### Gun Boost

- [Sapienza Shooting Violin Boost](https://youtu.be/4FTHkqCRAWU?t=9): Drop breakable object, shoot object to boost upwards.

### Boost Examples (with Breaching Charge)

Same as regular breakable object boosts, but breaching charge can propel you farther.

**Generally speaking, most breaching charge boosts are highly inconsistent, and are not viable for full game.**

- [Sgail Boost with Breaching Charge and Suitcase](https://youtu.be/LtnYqLLBPvs?t=3): Throw breakable violin onto suitcase, then use breaching charge to propel 47 even higher over ledge

- [SF boost with Breaching Charge, no Suitcase, Dropped Breakable](https://youtu.be/0uC-qfsMTpk): Drop breakable violin, use breaching charge to propel 47 very high into air.

## Boosting (No Breakable Objects)

### Cover Aim Boost

_Credit to [ThatObserver](https://www.speedrun.com/users/ThatObserver) for the guide below_

- First, you need to find a crouch cover that gets 47 relatively close to the wall.
- Get as close as you can
- While in cover aim 45 degrees away from the wall you want to get in (can use camera to do this too)
- Un-aim in
- You'll notice 47 is more in the wall now
- To get the extra bit to get in you physically turn the other way (Pressing A or D) while still in cover and just as you are about to complete the animation you press Uncover and you should clip in

### Subdue Boost

- **Instructions**
  - Take Cover against a low barrier such as a couch or some crates (facing NPC)
  - Press A or D (keyboard) or tap sideways on analog stick (controller) to turn around while in cover
  - While turning around (~246ms after starting turn), start subduing NPC
  - Height reached and how fast you fall back down (faster FPS = faster fall) is determined by FPS
