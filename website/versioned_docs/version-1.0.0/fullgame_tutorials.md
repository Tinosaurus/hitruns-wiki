Specific Strategy Tutorials for fullgame speedrun tutorials

Disclaimer: Not all maps have a tutorial listed here. That may be because we have a shortage of well commentated and knowledgable tutorials for that map, or that said map is not considered particularly difficult.

## SASO Pro

### Meta Strategies Overview

- [Moo's 21:46 Trilogy run (Good Overview)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7rvM9sJXes). Any outdated fullgame strategies listed below.
  - Paris is slightly outdated, see [35s version](https://youtu.be/10LNYNs5TkE).
    - Note: Bomb launch setup may need adjustment as of July 24, 2022 patch. You may now need to drop the breaching charge a bit later and the CX explosive a bit earlier than what is shown in the above video.
  - Sapienza is slightly outdated, see [new 59s version with Molotov](https://youtu.be/L48_cPcfAyo).
  - Marrakesh is slightly outdated, see [Marrakesh 0:3X](https://youtu.be/wqpDMdvhoAU)
  - Bangkok is slightly outdated, see [Bangkok 0:2X](https://youtu.be/DfEQBmea1_0)
  - Santa Fortuna may be outdated, see [Santa Fortuna 1:2x](https://youtu.be/sUHJbv5ebNA?t=931)
  - Sgail may be outdated, see [Sgail 0:54-1:00](https://youtu.be/yMkjtXXBf9Q)

### Commentated Walkthroughs

- [Paris Bomb Launch 0:4X](https://youtu.be/4zrEvV_nwGI)
  - Note: Bomb launch setup may need adjustment as of July 24, 2022 patch. You may now need to drop the breaching charge a bit later and the CX explosive a bit earlier than what is shown in the above video.
  - This strategy is slightly outdated, there is now a [35s version](https://youtu.be/10LNYNs5TkE), but the explanation above is still helpful.
- [Sapienza 1:2X (Including Cliff Boost)](https://youtu.be/BqgSfJlBoGU)
  - This strategy can now be considered outdated with [new 59s version with Molotov](https://youtu.be/L48_cPcfAyo), but the explanation above is still helpful in any Sapienza run.
- [Marrakesh 0:3X](https://youtu.be/wqpDMdvhoAU)
- [Bangkok 0:2X](https://youtu.be/DfEQBmea1_0)

### Beginner-Friendly(ish) Strats

- [Tsta's 29:36 Trilogy SA/SO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vR9otQKNVAw)
  - Some strategies may be riskier for new players, such as Paris, Sapienza, Dartmoor.
- [Solderq35's 37:42 Trilogy SA/SO](https://youtu.be/jHzyLh_Gy8c)
  - Turn on Youtube Subtitles for text commentary.
  - Colorado strategy here is somewhat outdated due to lighting changes, use Tsta's Colorado strategy instead.

Other Beginner Routes to consider:

- [1:27 easy Paris SA/SO alternative](https://youtu.be/U4tb4vn5UbY)
  - Middle ground (in terms of speed and difficulty) compared to the Paris strat shown in the 29:36 and 37:42 trilogy runs.
- [1:44 easy Sapienza](https://youtu.be/TUSgSfCZIe0)
  - Easier virus and Silvio kills
- [2:33 easy Romania](https://youtu.be/6m9DA8020e8)
  - For full game run you may want to wait for the guard to turn around at 1:30 IGT before jumping down.
  - If the commander distraction shot at 1:50 IGT looks to complicated, you can just throw to distract as [shown here](https://youtu.be/GMM85dJpTQ8?t=104)

### Seasonal Only

- [Paris 30s](https://youtu.be/zoZFALSCoLs?t=6)
  - Might be consistent enough for trilogy
- [Miami 17s](https://youtu.be/H1gRKLHN6k0)
- [Miami 20s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxa7gFswhxA)
- [Dubai 17s Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cmZn47I7sY)
  - Probably not consistent enough for trilogy, just good for Season 3 runs
  - See also: [Dubai 16s](https://youtu.be/MB029LdQci8?t=7) (mostly the same but shoot Marcus slightly sooner)
- [Romania 2:1X Tutorial](https://youtu.be/F0mYxJ0CE2s?t=154)
- Anything else from these runs:
  - [Moodehh's Season 1 3:52 SA/SO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zoZFALSCoLs)
  - [Housen's Season 3 5:58 SA/SO](https://youtu.be/MB029LdQci8)
- See the other seasonal (Season 1 / 2 / 3) SASO Pro records [here](https://www.speedrun.com/hitman_3/full_game) for other faster but riskier strategies.

## SASO Master

Short summary of pro / master differences:

- Longer viewcones
- NPC can hear your footsteps when you trespass
  - Note: Inconsistent mechanic, NPC will react to footsteps at random distances every time
- Some items are moved (moreso on Season 1 than Season 2 or 3)
- Extra guards / enforcers / cameras (moreso on Season 1 than Season 2 or 3)

### Meta Strategies Overview

- [Segmented Commentated Run from Aspecticor (23 minutes estimate)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA6mjuBUNfY)
  - Commentary is somewhat surface level, refer to Pro SASO tutorials above for more insight.
- [Segmented "Ideal" Strats from Moodehh (20:45)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naftsNAnoxw)
  - No commentary. Difficult strats executed to a high level but it shows what is possible on Master SASO full game.
- See the other seasonal (Season 1 / 2 / 3) SASO Master records [here](https://www.speedrun.com/hitman_3/full_game) for other faster but riskier strategies.

## SA Pro / Master

List of maps that can benefit from a disguise for speed and consistency on SA category:

- Paris
- Sapienza
- Colorado (Maybe, needs development)
- Hokkaido
- Santa Fortuna (Speed is comparable to SA/SO but probably safer with disguise)
- Sgail
- New York (Whether this is faster somewhat depends on Athena cycle RNG)
- Dartmoor
- Berlin
- Mendoza
- Romania (You'll lose a few seconds getting a disguise but it's arguably worth it for consistency)

### Meta Strategies Overview

- [Yannini 22:02 run](https://youtu.be/DkgcftoZghA)
  - Some strategies outdated, compare with [SASO Pro section above](fullgame_tutorials#saso-pro)
- [Moodehh Season 1 SA 3:31 run](https://youtu.be/vy6sVpPhza8)
- See the other seasonal (Season 1 / 2 / 3) SA Pro records [here](https://www.speedrun.com/hitman_3/full_game) for other faster but riskier strategies.

## Any%

- For Any% Trilogy, is recommended to compare and contrast the [first](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFkbE0_fr3c) and [second](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsUziP-UqMc) place runs, and use the fastest strategies from either.
- See the other seasonal (Season 1 / 2 / 3) Any% records [here](https://www.speedrun.com/hitman_3/full_game) for other faster but riskier strategies.
