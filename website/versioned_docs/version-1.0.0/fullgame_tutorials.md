Specific Strategy Tutorials for fullgame speedrun tutorials

Disclaimer: Not all maps have a tutorial listed here. That may be because we have a shortage of well commentated and knowledgable tutorials for that map, or that said map is not considered particularly difficult.

## SASO Pro

### Meta Strategies Overview
* [Moo's 21:46 Trilogy run (Good Overview)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7rvM9sJXes). Any outdated fullgame strategies listed below.
	* Paris is slightly outdated, see [35s version](https://youtu.be/10LNYNs5TkE).
	* Sapienza is slightly outdated, see [new 59s version with Molotov](https://youtu.be/L48_cPcfAyo).
	* Marrakesh is slightly outdated, see [Marrakesh 0:3X](https://youtu.be/wqpDMdvhoAU)
	* Bangkok is slightly outdated, see [Bangkok 0:2X](https://youtu.be/DfEQBmea1_0)
	* Santa Fortuna may be outdated, see [Santa Fortuna 1:2x](https://youtu.be/sUHJbv5ebNA?t=931)
	* Sgail may be outdated, see [Sgail 0:54-1:00](https://youtu.be/yMkjtXXBf9Q)


### Commentated Walkthroughs
* [Paris Bomb Launch 0:4X](https://youtu.be/4zrEvV_nwGI)
	* Note: Bomb launch setup may need adjustment as of July 24, 2022 patch. You may now need to drop the breaching charge a bit later and the CX explosive a bit earlier than what is shown in the above video.
	* This strategy is slightly outdated, there is now a [35s version](https://youtu.be/10LNYNs5TkE), but the explanation above is still helpful.
* [Sapienza 1:2X (Including Cliff Boost)](https://youtu.be/BqgSfJlBoGU)
	* This strategy can now be considered outdated with [new 59s version with Molotov](https://youtu.be/L48_cPcfAyo), but the explanation above is still helpful in any Sapienza run.
* [Marrakesh 0:3X](https://youtu.be/wqpDMdvhoAU)
* [Bangkok 0:2X](https://youtu.be/DfEQBmea1_0)

### Beginner-Friendly(ish) Strats
* [Tsta's 29:36 Trilogy SA/SO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vR9otQKNVAw)
	* Some strategies may be riskier for new players, such as Paris, Sapienza, Dartmoor.
* [Solderq35's 37:42 Trilogy SA/SO](https://youtu.be/jHzyLh_Gy8c)
	* Turn on Youtube Subtitles for text commentary.
	* Colorado strategy here is somewhat outdated due to lighting changes, use Tsta's Colorado strategy instead.
	
Other Beginner Routes to consider:
* [1:27 easy Paris SA/SO alternative](https://youtu.be/U4tb4vn5UbY)
	* Middle ground (in terms of speed and difficulty) compared to the Paris strat shown in the 29:36 and 37:42 trilogy runs. 
* [1:44 easy Sapienza](https://youtu.be/TUSgSfCZIe0)
	* Easier virus and Silvio kills
* [2:58 easy Romania](https://youtu.be/qk6z9Pg_Lxg)
	* No ending panic shots



### Seasonal Only
* [Paris 30s](https://youtu.be/zoZFALSCoLs?t=6)
	* Might be consistent enough for trilogy
* [Miami 17s](https://youtu.be/H1gRKLHN6k0)
* [Miami 20s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxa7gFswhxA)
* [Dubai 17s Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cmZn47I7sY)
	* Probably not consistent enough for trilogy, just good for Season 3 runs
* [Romania 2:1X Tutorial](https://youtu.be/F0mYxJ0CE2s?t=154)
* Anything else from these runs: 
	* [Moodehh's Season 1 3:52 SA/SO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zoZFALSCoLs)
	* [Housen's Season 3 6:06 SA/SO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arQyev_l_Vk)
