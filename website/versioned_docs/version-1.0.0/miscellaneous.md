## Cutscene Wait
Cutscene waiting is a great way to speed up a run. While the cutscene plays, NPC's in the level will already start moving, which means you can save in-game time otherwise spent waiting for an NPC to move into position.

* Note that sometimes you must perform certain actions in a route ASAP and as such you do not have time to play cutscene

* Note that default starting locations have longer cutscenes (sometimes nearing a minute) vs other locations (10-20 seconds)

* [Example](https://youtu.be/F5SXFdx04pI?t=18): This player played about 20 seconds of cutscene. As a result Maya Parvarti walked under the hay bale at 1:41. Without waiting cutscene Parvarti walks under hay bale at about 2 minutes.

## Unlocking Doors
Some of the methods of unlocking doors were covered [here](https://www.speedrun.com/hitman_3/guide/h5jij), but I will go more into depth on the topic here as well.

General guidelines:
*  Lockpick and Crowbar obviously only work on physical lock doors, while scramblers/ key hackers and EMP only work on electric doors.
* All SMG's, assault rifles, sniper rifles, shotguns, striker/ matador and full auto pistols can shoot open physical lock doors and electric swinging doors alike. You cannot shoot open sliding electric doors with guns.
* You can open doors with semi-auto pistols, refer [here](https://www.speedrun.com/hitman_3/guide/h5jij#ch13_quot_Mudshot_quot_) for more info.
* [Example video](https://youtu.be/voBsuKu-thI?t=136)
* You can additionally speed this up by [not pausing until you take the first shot](https://youtu.be/voBsuKu-thI?t=148), although this is riskier.
* Explosives can generally open physical lock doors and electric swinging doors, but not electric sliding doors.

Concussive explosives are much less audible making them only be heard in the room that they have exploded in. These are a great alternative.
* [Example](https://youtu.be/rLJJKdxbMas?t=46)
* Note that shaman powder is as audible as a regular explosive

## Fast Disguise Change
There are several disguise change animations, some of which are slower than others. To avoid the slow disguise change animation, it is best to crouch before taking disguise, or else to grab the body before changing disguise.
* [Example 1](https://youtu.be/hxXunF1WkeM?t=57): Slow disguise change animation (where 47 runs his hands along each arm). This happens sometimes if you are standing when you take disguise. Avoid this at all costs!
* [Example 2](https://youtu.be/B-T12TJfHBM?t=44): Notice how 47 does a faster animation without running his hands along his arms.
* [Example 3](https://youtu.be/2HGNgKRJMdc?t=55): Grabbing body before disguise change is also a way to avoid the slow disguise change animation. Note this works even if you are standing up before grabbing body.

## Strafe to avoid Inventory Stutter
Strafe slightly to one side for roughly 0.00001s-0.3s and press to open the inventory while doing so
* [Example](https://youtu.be/E27yVaESkTY)
* Note: Strafing into inventory also helps you get to the inventory right away after throwing an item. Otherwise there is a noticeable delay.

## NPC Clipping
* Only works for real NPC
* Will persist until you close the game
* [Video Guide](https://youtu.be/-iaWEkmj9ko)

## Map Buffering for Throws
* Buffering map while throwing will make an object bounce farther across the ground when thrown
* [Example video](https://youtu.be/j3RKns5wbbc)
* Note that only map seems to work, not inventory or pause
* Note that only the bounce distance seems affected, not the initial throw distance.

## Legacy Guard Behavior
* Getting spotted holding an illegal item by a target's VIP bodyguard may result in the guard entering a state of blindness ([Example](https://youtu.be/Sxo4AeX8W5Y?t=38))
* If you are in guard disguise guns are legal, so you will need to aim gun to get the same response ([Example](https://youtu.be/l5xo6fOUSq0?t=15))

## RFID Coin Properties
* RFID coin can trigger proximity related things, such as Truck exit in Mumbai, Into the Woods exit in Berlin, Bridge exit in Dartmoor
* [Example of using RFID coin to exit early in Mumbai](https://youtu.be/sK0xEhyFI_I?t=12)

## Glossary

### Full Lockdown

Targets in direct danger are taken to a safe space by their VIP guards and heavily protected.

### Soft Lockdown

Targets that witness panic will retreat to a 'safe space', often closer and less secure than a full lockdown. Their VIP guards can enter 'searching', abandoning the target. Targets that witness their VIP guard panic will enter Full Lockdown state (Needs more testing)

### Bad Shelter

When a Target or VIP guard (sometimes telepathically) considers lockdown location compromised, and redirects to a secondary lockdown point.
