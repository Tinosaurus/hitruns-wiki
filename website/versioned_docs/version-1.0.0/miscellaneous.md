## Cutscene Wait

Cutscene waiting is a great way to speed up a run. While the cutscene plays, NPC's in the level will already start moving, which means you can save in-game time otherwise spent waiting for an NPC to move into position.

- Note that sometimes you must perform certain actions in a route ASAP and as such you do not have time to play cutscene

- Note that default starting locations have longer cutscenes (sometimes nearing a minute) vs other locations (10-20 seconds)

- [Example](https://youtu.be/F5SXFdx04pI?t=18): This player played about 20 seconds of cutscene. As a result Maya Parvarti walked under the hay bale at 1:41. Without waiting cutscene Parvarti walks under hay bale at about 2 minutes.

- Following NPC's aren't affected by cutscene wait: Rico Delgado, Sierra Knox in racecar (from the default Miami start), Ljudmilla Vetrova.

## Unlocking Doors

Some of the methods of unlocking doors were covered [here](guns), but I will go more into depth on the topic here as well.

General guidelines:

- Lockpick and Crowbar obviously only work on physical lock doors, while scramblers/ key hackers and EMP only work on electric doors.
- All SMG's, assault rifles, sniper rifles, shotguns, striker/ matador and full auto pistols can shoot open physical lock doors and electric swinging doors alike. You cannot shoot open sliding electric doors with guns.
- You can open doors with semi-auto pistols, refer [here](guns#mudshot) for more info.
- Explosives can generally open physical lock doors and electric swinging doors, but not electric sliding doors.

Concussive explosives are much less audible making them only be heard in the room that they have exploded in. These are a great alternative.

- [Example](https://youtu.be/rLJJKdxbMas?t=46)
- Note that shaman powder is as audible as a regular explosive

## Map Buffering for Throws

- Buffering map while throwing will make an object bounce farther across the ground when thrown
- [Example video](https://youtu.be/j3RKns5wbbc)
- Note that only map seems to work, not inventory or pause
- Note that only the bounce distance seems affected, not the initial throw distance.

## Legacy Guard Behavior

- Getting spotted holding an illegal item by a target's VIP bodyguard may result in the guard entering a state of blindness ([Example](https://youtu.be/Sxo4AeX8W5Y?t=38))
- If you are in guard disguise guns are legal, so you will need to aim gun to get the same response ([Example](https://youtu.be/l5xo6fOUSq0?t=15))

## First Person Mode Glitch

- First Person Mode Glitch is sometimes useful for long range pistol snipes. Note that this does not make your gun itself more accurate, just lets you see farther.
- Inputs: **Press and hold** the Use Camera Button (Right Click on PC) > Zoom in camera (Optional, default PC keybind is X) > Pause > **Briefly Tap** the Use Camera button (Right Click) > Go to Inventory to select gun (optional)
  - Warning: Make sure to exit the first person mode by equipping the camera again and pressing the Use Camera Button before you reset the level / die / etc. Otherwise game will crash.

### Full Lockdown

Targets in direct danger are taken to a safe space by their VIP guards and heavily protected. Will be indicated by "Target Lockdown" showing up above minimap, and sometimes accompanied by fire alarms.

- [Example in The Author](https://youtu.be/OVpFIYqUaEI?t=12): Note the first target (Brother Akram) is escorted by guards and "Target Lockdown" shows up above minimap.

### Soft Lockdown

Targets that witness panic will retreat to a 'safe space', often closer and less secure than a full lockdown. Their VIP guards can enter 'searching', abandoning the target. Targets that witness their VIP guard panic will enter Full Lockdown state (Needs more testing). Soft lockdown can be more useful than Full Lockdown sometimes as the guards are less likely to follow the target in a soft lockdown, and also because there will be less chaos in the level overall.

- [Example in Bangkok](https://youtu.be/fnyUisYu_zA?t=24): Panicking some NPC outside Jordan's booth triggers a soft lockdown later.

### Bad Shelter

When a Target or VIP guard (sometimes telepathically) considers lockdown location compromised, and redirects to a secondary lockdown point.

- [Example in Sapienza](https://youtu.be/bCdb6o46DxE): After initially panicking Francesca, panic the guards in a room ahead of her path so that by the time she gets there, that area isn't safe and she will go to another location for lockdown instead.
