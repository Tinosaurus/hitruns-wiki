## Fast Throw (All Platforms)
### Fast throw (at NPC's)
* Press the crouch button, then press the throw button, then press crouch again to un-crouch all in quick succession. The second crouch button press is unnecessary, but it make the animation smoother and makes you ready for a second fast throw. Fast throw will make your throw at an NPC come out half a second faster (ish) per throw.
* Additional notes: Fast throw at NPC doesn't really work with large items (e.g. propane or axes), nor if you are facing away from NPC

### Fast throw (not at NPC's)
Note: Instructions above mainly cover how to do this while throwing something at NPC face to KO them, but crouch and uncrouch can also speed up animation of throwing items in general, even when not hitting an NPC.

* Fast throw (not at NPC) works quite well with large items, such as propane, axe, briefcases

## Fast Interact 

* Disclaimer the below methods are not the *only* way of fast interact, just the easiest methods
* Note that if you have a briefcase in your hand, you will need to have an additional item (so briefcase in left hand, additional item in right), to be able to make this work easily. Otherwise you may conceal an item in briefcase instead of instant interacting.

### PC Fast Interact Instructions

For PC, this trick can be used for any circle prompt tied to the default interact button (G). This includes, but is not limited to, exits, turning on sinks, turning on radios, and unlocking doors. 

* To do the trick, press and hold inventory (default button I) when in front of an interact prompt. While inventory button is held down, tap on the inventory key (G).

 This trick will save about half a second per use, enabling you to instantly trigger the prompt instead of waiting to fill up circle.
