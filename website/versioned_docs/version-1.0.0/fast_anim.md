## General Tip - Crouch

- You generally will run faster if uncrouched, but in some cases it is better to crouch or quickly toggle crouch and uncrouch.
  - It is faster to crouch when running down stairs, although you can save even more time via [gunslide](fast_anim#gunslide) or by [boosting](boosting#stair-boost)
  - Toggling crouch can be beneficial while opening doors, [particularly sliding doors](https://youtu.be/enYuDoQ9Rvw?t=10)
  - Toggling crouch is beneficial for [fast throw](fast_anim#fast-throw-all-platforms)
  - Crouching can give you faster animations for some prompts, as [shown here](https://youtu.be/XPyBK2yCC5o?t=9)
  - You will switch between items in your hands faster when crouched (most noticeable when swapping from holding a sniper rifle to a pistol).
  - You can pick items up more quickly if you toggle crouch and uncrouch just before / afterwards.
  - You can change disguise faster if you toggle crouch and uncrouch during the animation.

## Fast Interact

Disclaimer: the below methods are not the _only_ way of fast interact, just the easiest methods.
This trick will save about half a second per use, enabling you to instantly trigger the prompt instead of waiting to fill up circle.

### PC Fast Interact Instructions

For PC, this trick can be used for any circle prompt tied to the default interact button (G). This includes, but is not limited to, exits, turning on sinks, turning on radios, and unlocking doors.

Note: The PC section here is more detailed, but anything written here should also work on console, just translate the inputs to what they should be for controller.

- Basic Version Inputs: Press Inventory > Interact Button (Default key G) when in front of a prompt.

  - [Sink fast interact example](https://youtu.be/muO9Mm3yUvQ?t=14)
  - [Fast exit example](https://youtu.be/muO9Mm3yUvQ?t=53)
  - If you are waiting for the exit prompt to show up after a kill, remember that the fast interact only works when you are in the inventory menu. So the optimal inventory buffering inputs for exit are:
    - Tap Inventory once (Enter Inventory) > Can take a breather here > Double tap Inventory as fast as possible (Leave and re-enter Inventory ASAP) > Can take a breathe here > Double Tap Inventory > And So On Until the Exit Appears > Tap Interact (G) to leave

- If you have an item in a briefcase while you try to fast interact, then you have a few choices to make the fast interact work correctly (you may only retrieve an item from the briefcase otherwise).
  - Option 1: Drop the briefcase before interacting. **Honestly, you should always drop the briefcase, as holding a briefcase will always add movement delay after interacting with an object**. It's faster to drop the briefcase, interact with the prompt, then pick your briefcase back up afterewards.
  - Option 2: Equip an item in your right hand. This cancels out the briefcase retrieve effect.
  - Option 3: If you have to have the briefcase in your left hand for some reason and nothing else, then move to another item in your inventory during fast interact
    - Inputs: Inventory > A or D to select another item > Interact Button (G)
- For The Vector where you can't access the Inventory menu, you can fast interact with the exit by using pause menu.
  - Inputs: Pause(Esc) > Interact Button (G) > Pause(Esc)
  - The second Interact > Pause need to be performed in quick succession, too slow and it won't work.
    - [Example of Pause Menu Fast Interact](https://youtu.be/IUjtWujwdL0?t=20)
  - Pause Menu fast interact can also be used to fast interact with frisks.

### Console Fast Interact

For console, fast interact can be used for any circle prompt tied to the buttons triangle, circle, and X (on PS4), or Y, A, and B (on XB1).
This includes, but it not limited to, picking up items, disguise changes, dragging bodies, and exits/ sinks/ radios/ unlocking doors.

#### Playstation Instructions

For fast pickup, fast exit, fast interact with sinks/ radios/ unlocking doors etc:

- When by a drag body or unpack briefcase prompt, press inventory button (D-pad left or right button), then square OR circle, then triangle in quick succession.

For fast disguise change:

- When by a pickup/ interact prompt, press inventory (D-pad left or right button), then square OR circle, then X in quick succession.

For fast body drag / briefcase retrieve:

- When by a body drag or unpack briefcase prompt, press inventory (D-pad left or right button), then square OR circle , then circle in quick succession.
- See the [Fast Briefcase Unpack](fast_anim#console-fast-sniper-briefcase-unpack) section for more info on fast sniper briefcase unpack.

#### Xbox Instructions

For fast pickup, fast exit, fast interact with sinks/ radios/ unlocking doors etc:

- When by a pickup/ interact prompt, press inventory button (D-pad left or right button), then X OR B, then Y in quick succession

For fast disguise change:

- When by a disguise change prompt, press inventory button (D-pad left or right button), then X OR B, then A in quick succession

For fast body drag / briefcase retrieve:

- When by a drag body or unpack briefcase prompt, press inventory button (D-pad left or right button), then X OR B, then B in quick succession.
- See the [Fast Briefcase Unpack](fast_anim#console-fast-sniper-briefcase-unpack) section for more info on fast sniper briefcase unpack.

## Fast Sniper Briefcase Unpack

Saves about half a second overall

- Technically this works with all large items that can be unpacked from briefcases, but most common use is with sniper rifle.
- To perform fast unpack, the optimal inputs are:
  - Look Down > Drop > Unpack > Crouch > Wait 0.5 seconds > Uncrouch
  - [Basic Example Video (Unpack and Keep Running)](https://youtu.be/Bg8e-i3lYVk)
    - The above video includes unpacking both from an Agency Pickup briefcase on the ground as well as a briefcase in your hand. **Inputs are shown via Nohboard.**
    - **Keybinds for reference**: Unpack (1), Crouch (2), Drop (3)
- If you need to shoot something right after unpacking the optimal inputs will be:
  - Look Down > Drop > Unpack > Crouch > Aim (Right Mouse Button) + Marksman Mode (Shift button) + Uncrouch (Optional)
  - **Pressing Shift(Marksman) and Aim as you unpack is important so that you can seamlessly transition from unpacking to aiming, and enter the Marksman slow-mo aiming as soon as possible.**
  - [Example of Fast Unpack into Shoot](https://youtu.be/h_LRqv0hrFQ)
    - Both variants of staying crouched or uncrouching while scoped in are shown in the above video. **Inputs are shown via Nohboard.**
    - **Keybinds for reference**: Unpack (1), Crouch (2/C), Drop (3/Alt), Marksman (Shift), Aim (Right Mouse Button).
    - Uncrouching at the end should be done if you either need to keep running after unpacking (standing back up avoids an awkward shuffle animation), or you need to be standing up to shoot a particular spot. Otherwise, it's best to stay crouched for the shot as it simplifies inputs, and because standing up while aiming can throw your aim or timing off.
  - [Another Example of Fast Unpack Shoot with Uncrouch](https://youtu.be/IHufpS-Veaw?t=7)
    - This may more clearly demonstrate the use case of uncrouching, this distraction shot won't hit right spot from a crouch.

### Console Fast Sniper Briefcase Unpack

- You can more or less follow the same inputs as explained above, however on console it is also necessary to use [fast briefcase retrieve trick](fast_anim#console-fast-interact) for the "Unpack" step.
- [Example 1](https://youtu.be/5pochP7Ynek?t=36)
- [Example 2](https://youtu.be/ijf7khHNFEE?t=372)

## Fast Throw (All Platforms)

### Fast throw (at NPC's)

- Inputs: Crouch > Throw > Uncrouch
- Additional notes

  - Fast throw at NPC doesn't really work with large items (e.g. propane or axes), nor if you are facing away from NPC
  - If you want to access the inventory right after throwing, you may need to strafe left or right before going to inventory, to avoid animation delay.

- [PC Example](https://youtu.be/tBnykFC3fE4?t=24)
- [Console Example](https://youtu.be/cyuw5pHubsk?t=78)

### Fast throw (not at NPC's)

- Inputs: Crouch > Throw > Uncrouch
- [Example of fast throw of violin onto ground](https://youtu.be/m9HkkYNEOBI?t=23)
- Fast throw (not at NPC) works quite well with large items, such as propane, axe, briefcases. This is in contract to fast throw at NPC head, which works better with small items.
- If you want to access the inventory right after throwing, you may need to strafe left or right before going to inventory, to avoid animation delay.

## Fast Disguise Change

There are several disguise change animations, some of which are slower than others.

- The most common animation involves 47 starting standing, and then bending down, [as shown here](https://youtu.be/d4JPMVRApWk?t=55). This can be further sped up by pressing crouch and uncrouch buttons during the animation.
- A slower animation will be seen sometimes when you have just knocked out an NPC and you try to take their disguise while they are still ragdolling, [as shown here](https://youtu.be/dhNpzL7rbc4?t=157). 47 will remain standing and run his hands along each hand which slows down the animation.
  - If you just knocked out an NPC, then it may be faster to grab the body first, [as shown here](https://youtu.be/2HGNgKRJMdc?t=55).
  - Just staying crouched may also be better than standing if you just knocked out the NPC you need the disguise of.

## Strafe to avoid Inventory Stutter

Strafe slightly to one side for roughly 0.00001s-0.3s and press to open the inventory while doing so

- [Example](https://youtu.be/E27yVaESkTY)
- Note: Strafing into inventory also helps you get to the inventory right away after throwing an item. Otherwise there is a noticeable delay.

## NPC Clipping

- Only works for real NPC
- Will persist until you close the game
- [Video Guide](https://youtu.be/-iaWEkmj9ko)
  - The window for getting this is pretty tight, you need to restart the frame you start to clip into the NPC. Press pause before you can even see 47 phasing inside the npc, so that you can pause the exact frame it happens.

## Gunslide

A bit faster than just running down normally.

- Basic Version:
  - Turn the camera such that 47 is running face first at the camera, and crouch run down the stairs / slope. While you are doing that, press and hold the shoot button (Left mouse button). Do not press the aim button (Right mouse button). Drop and pick up pistol, press aim button, or holster weapon to stop the glide.
  - [Example of basic gunslide](https://youtu.be/voBsuKu-thI?t=28)
  - This also works on [Sapienza cliff](https://youtu.be/l5xo6fOUSq0?t=38). Remember to only click shoot button and not aim button, and to be crouched and with correct camera angle.

More advanced versions of gunslide include gunslide with railing. In this case crouching is not needed.

- [Gunslide on railing while facing forwards](https://youtu.be/XPyBK2yCC5o?t=16)
- [Gunslide on railing while facing backwards](https://youtu.be/7mrfqKj86c0?t=100)
