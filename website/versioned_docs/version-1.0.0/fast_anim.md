## Fast Throw (All Platforms)
### Fast throw (at NPC's)
* Press the crouch button, then press the throw button, then press crouch again to un-crouch all in quick succession. The second crouch button press is unnecessary, but it make the animation smoother and makes you ready for a second fast throw. Fast throw will make your throw at an NPC come out half a second faster (ish) per throw.
* Additional notes: Fast throw at NPC doesn't really work with large items (e.g. propane or axes), nor if you are facing away from NPC

### Fast throw (not at NPC's)
Note: Instructions above mainly cover how to do this while throwing something at NPC face to KO them, but crouch and uncrouch can also speed up animation of throwing items in general, even when not hitting an NPC.

* Fast throw (not at NPC) works quite well with large items, such as propane, axe, briefcases

## Fast Interact 

Disclaimer: the below methods are not the *only* way of fast interact, just the easiest methods.
 This trick will save about half a second per use, enabling you to instantly trigger the prompt instead of waiting to fill up circle.

### PC Fast Interact Instructions

For PC, this trick can be used for any circle prompt tied to the default interact button (G). This includes, but is not limited to, exits, turning on sinks, turning on radios, and unlocking doors. 

Note: The PC section here is more detailed, but anything written here should also work on console, just translate the inputs to what they should be for controller.

* Basic Version: Press Inventory > Interact Button (Default key G) when in front of a prompt.

	* [Fast exit example](https://youtu.be/muO9Mm3yUvQ?t=53)
	* If you are waiting for the exit prompt to show up after a kill, remember that the fast interact only works when you are in the inventory menu. So the optimal inventory buffering inputs for exit are: 
		* Tap Inventory once (Enter Inventory) > Can take a breather here > Double tap Inventory as fast as possible (Leave and re-enter Inventory ASAP) > Can take a breathe here > Double Tap Inventory > And So On Until the Exit Appears > Tap Interact (G) to leave

* If you have an item in a briefcase while you try to fast interact, then you have a few choices to make the fast interact work correctly (you may only retrieve an item from the briefcase otherwise).
	* Option 1: Drop the briefcase before interacting. **Honestly, you should always drop the briefcase, as holding a briefcase will always add movement delay after interacting with an object**. It's faster to drop the briefcase, interact with the prompt, then pick your briefcase back up afterewards.
	* Option 2: Equip an item in your right hand. This cancels out the briefcase retrieve effect.
	* Option 3: If you have to have the briefcase in your left hand for some reason and nothing else, then move to another item in your inventory during fast interact 
		* Inputs: Inventory > A or D to select another item > Interact Button (G)
	
* For The Vector where you can't access the Inventory menu, you can fast interact with the exit by using pause menu.
	* Inputs: Pause(Esc) > Interact Button (G) > Pause(Esc)
	* The second Interact > Pause need to be performed in quick succession, too slow and it won't work.

	* Pause Menu fast interact can also be used to fast interact with frisks.
