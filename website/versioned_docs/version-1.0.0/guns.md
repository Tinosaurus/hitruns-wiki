# Useful Guns

If you do not know how to unlock any of the below weapons, check Hitman Wiki's Unlocks/ Mastery guide in Resources.

## Ballistic Pistols
ICA19 and its variants are overall the most accurate silenced pistol. Note that the ICA 19 Silverballer's "precise aim" is a placebo and doesn't actually improve the accuracy of the gun. This is confirmed by multiple renowned speedrunners such as Mendietinha, and Frote7.

Krugermeier can sometimes be useful because both the gunshot and bullet impact are quieter, which can sometimes prevent panic/ getting spotted. This does come at the price of an accuracy reduction compared to ICA19.

HWK21 Pale Homemade Silencer is a decent pistol that is accurate and has less recoil than ICA19, but it also does less damage than any other pistol, so beware if trying to kill with body shots.

DAK X2 Covert and ICA 19 F/A stealth are silenced handheld guns that can shoot open almost any swinging door, physical or electric lock alike. However, since they are also full auto, they are less useful for precise bullet distractions.

## Sniper Rifles

Sniper rifles can also shoot swinging doors open, so you may not need a lockpick or disposable scrambler if you're already bringing a sniper rifle.
* [Example of shooting door open with sniper rifle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoMQOQgOWQQ&list=PLflusD4O8jzNubvmK7dMBgbZ6Vsl-qiwR&index=2) 

Sieger 300 Ghost is usually the best all-around sniper to to having fast unpack, maximum zoom, maximum damage (can blow up car in two shots from any distance, OHKO any NPC from any distance), and also being the most silent (subsonic perk). 

However, the non-Ghost Sieger 300 variants can also be useful for times when you **do not** want to one hit kill people. 
* [Example of using Sieger 300 Advanced on Ljudmilla- Bullet does not kill Ljudmilla on impact, but pushes her into water for fall accident.](https://youtu.be/1_jXK9Pbg8E?t=37)
* [Example of using Sieger 300 to avoid killing scientist near virus when shooting virus](https://youtu.be/CASEkNKCG8I?t=236)

Hackl Levithan Sniper Rifle Covert is also worth considering if you want a piercing sniper rifle (only silenced sniper rifle with piercing and fast unpack animation).

## Dart Guns

Kalmer does not fire bullets, but its tranquilizing effect is very useful. Besides the obvious application of public knockouts, guards are temporarily unable to frisk you or spot you trespassing while they are looking at a body unconscious from a Kalmer. 
* [Example of using Kalmer to avoid getting spotted for trespassing](https://youtu.be/m6UieQE2VD8?t=99)

Sieker does not fire bullets, but its emetic effect is very useful. Besides the obvious application of making NPC's go to the toilet, it is also useful for just making NPC's blind and leave the area for more than a minute. 
* [Example of using Sieker on gardener so he cannot spot me later](https://youtu.be/ITWmeusSv48?t=33)

# Fast Sniper Briefcase Unpack
Saves about half a second overall
* Technically this works with all large items that can be unpacked from briefcases, but most common use is with sniper rifle.
* To perform fast unpack there are usually two variations:
* Version 1: Look Down > Drop Briefcase> Crouch > Unpack > Uncrouch ([Example](https://youtu.be/iFOvfjnZ3NY))
* Version 2: Look Down > Drop > Unpack > Crouch > Uncrouch ([Example](https://youtu.be/aFJtdC9DsCk?t=10))

# Snap Shooting
Generally speaking snap shooting refers to shooting quickly without aiming much before hand, using the white dot in the middle of screen to help aim at most.
* [Snap Shooting example](https://youtu.be/XPyBK2yCC5o?t=62)
* Also note that sniper rifles do not have the white dot in the middle of screen by default, but you can install [Crosshair V2](https://www.microsoft.com/en-is/p/crosshair-v2/9n1k9q56hvxr) (which is legal for Hitman 3 speedrun.com leaderboards), or simply put some white tape on your monitor.

Below, left click = mouse 1 AKA shoot, right click = mouse 2 AKA aim.
* Generally speaking, right click > left click is the most straightforwards input
* Note that you should never let go of right click before left click, that may result in delay, as shown [here](https://youtu.be/voBsuKu-thI?t=172)

Some other input options to consider to avoid snap shot stutter include: 
* Left click > drop gun and pick back up
* Left click > Right Click
* Right click > Left Click > Right Click
Caution: Left click > Drop and Left click > Right Click may be less accurate, better for distraction shots than for trying to shoot an NPC in the head.

Also see Stored Shot below.

# Stored Shot

While using Instinct, press the "fire gun" button (left click on PC). When you come out of Instinct and aim (right click on PC), you will perform a snap shot with zero stutters.
* [Example](https://youtu.be/xUrp7yAIqD0?t=204). Note going into Instinct just before shooting.

# Bullet Distractions (1 bullet)

The most obvious use of bullet distractions is to briefly turn an NPC around, or lure them to a particular spot. 
* [Example of 4 bullet distractions to turn NPC around](https://youtu.be/gp_m9OzlHl0?t=108)

A lesser known application of bullet distractions is to shoot the top of a wall/ ceiling to lure NPC's upstairs. This can be used not only to lure NPC's to another floor, but to just make an NPC leave the area for an extended period of time.
* [Example of ceiling lure](https://youtu.be/PxxPBKvBBNQ?t=24) (notice how lady goes upstairs)

# 2 shot bullet panic

A common use of 2 shot bullet panic is to panic civilians so they can't spot you trespassing.
* [Example bullet panic to avoid getting caught trespassing](https://youtu.be/gp_m9OzlHl0?t=241)

2 shot bullet panic can also be used to keep multiple NPC's looking in the direction you shot at for longer than if you just fired one shot. Beware this is risky, as NPC reactions to two bullets can be RNG.
* [Example of bullet panic to keep guards turned to the right](https://youtu.be/CASEkNKCG8I?t=387)

# Triple shot panic

When you triple shot a surface near a guard, they will home in on where you shot from. During this time they are unable to see you trespassing. Make sure you leave the area from where you shot as soon as possible, or else you may go into combat. Note that triple shot only works on guards, civilians react the same to triple shot as they would double shot. Note that triple shot blinds guards to everything, not just trespassing. You cannot be spotted wielding a weapon by guards panicked by triple shot, for instance.

**Disclaimer: this technique can be rather inconsistent and doesn't always work as expected. Sometimes you spontaneously go into combat when running past guard, sometimes an NPC runs an unexpected direction and causes panic.**

* [Example of using triple shot panic to blind them to trespassing](https://youtu.be/-TNnwIawiEw?t=51)

# Body shots

Unlike triple shot, body shot works both on guards and civilians. Body shot works pretty much the same as guards as triple shot, causing the guard to home in on where you shot from while blinded to any illegal action you perform. Body shotting civilians also blinds them to illegal actions you perform, but they will just run for a nearby guard instead of homing in on you. Note that body shotting makes NPC's blind to all illegal actions, not just trespassing. You can for example shoot a civilian so they can't spot you shooting something else.

**Disclaimer: this technique can be rather inconsistent and doesn't always work as expected. Sometimes you spontaneously go into combat when running past guard, sometimes an NPC runs an unexpected direction and causes panic.**

# Zoomed out aim

Sometimes you will get strangely zoomed out camera when aiming with pistol ([example](https://youtu.be/fEMuIEDegTE?t=69)). 

To prevent this, crouch and uncrouch before aiming.

# Gun-flashing
* Shooting a gun while an NPC is looking at you can sometimes result in a state of blindness similar to triple shot or body shot panic. 
* This seems more related to the action of firing the gun than to wherever the bullet goes
* [Example 1](https://youtu.be/Kv8gXsGnzy0?t=3)
* [Example 2](https://youtu.be/mKxcnWJD7oQ?t=4)
* [Example 3](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV12v4y1M7hX?t=1m16s)

# Gunslide
Hipfire (shoot without aiming) while moving down slope backwards. A bit faster than just running down normally.
The basic example is to turn the camera such that 47 is running face first at the camera, and crouch run down the stairs. While you are doing that, press and hold the shoot button (Mouse 1 by default on PC. Do not press the aim button Mouse 2). Drop and pick up pistol, press aim button, or holster weapon to stop the glide.

* [Example of basic gunslide](https://youtu.be/voBsuKu-thI?t=28)
* This also works on [Sapienza cliff](https://youtu.be/l5xo6fOUSq0?t=38). Remember to only click shoot button and not aim button, and to be crouched and with correct camera angle.

More advanced versions of gunslide include gunslide with railing. In this case crouching is not needed.
* [Gunslide on railng while facing forwards](https://youtu.be/XPyBK2yCC5o?t=16)
* [Gunslide on railing while facing backwards](https://youtu.be/7mrfqKj86c0?t=100)

# "Mudshot"
* You can open swinging doors with semi automatic pistols if you use pause buffering ("mudshot", named after discoverer muddye).

* Example. Note that Krugermeier and Hwk 21 Homemade may need more shots to work with this trick.
* Both pause and map work, although pause seems easier. The timing of the first pause is most important.
* Inputs (general guideline): Aim at door and hold aim button, pause, hold shoot button (should have both aim and shoot held by now), rapidly tap pause and unpause. You need as tiny a gap between unpause and pause as possible, but you can take a breather between pause and unpause.
