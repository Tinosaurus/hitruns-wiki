## No Longer Possible Runs

- No Longer Possible Runs are primarily tracked on [speedrun.com](https://www.speedrun.com/hitman_3) in their own category:
  ![Example of NLP](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/725721210121617419/1060469822711930920/image.png)

  - Please hover your mouse over the sticky note icon by each run (as shown in screenshot above) to see more information on why a particular run is No Longer Possible.

- In addition to being tracked on speedrun.com, we are also tracking No Longer Possible run on this google spreadsheet: https://hitruns.vercel.app/h3_patched_runs
  - However, we will prioritize listing the runs on speedrun.com itself going forwards, so look there first.

## List of Patches

Every patch that significantly affected Hitman 3 speedruns is listed below. An example video is given for each change, but refer to the spreadsheet above to see every run affected by the patch in question.

Disclaimer: Only patches that affected runs that were submitted to speedrun.com are included here (at least for now). You can also check [this page](downpatching#manifest-download-table--specific-patch-findings) for a more comprehensive look at every patch, but it includes some trivial patches.

Also note that this list only considers changes that **negatively** affected speedrunning techniques, because that's what causes a run to be invalidated.
