## List of Patches

Every patch that significantly affected Hitman 3 speedruns is listed below. An example video is given for each change, but refer to the spreadsheet above to see every run affected by the patch in question.

Disclaimer: Only patches that affected runs that were submitted to speedrun.com are included here (at least for now). You can also check [IOI's general patch notes page](https://www.ioi.dk/patch-notes-hitman3/), but it includes some trivial patches.

Also note that this list only considers changes that **negatively** affected speedrunning techniques, because that's what causes a run to be invalidated.
