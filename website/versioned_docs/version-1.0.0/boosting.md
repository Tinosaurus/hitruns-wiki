## Boosting Overview

- Once a Breakable item falls so far onto a surface it will break into pieces that we call 'Particles'.
- These particles have vertical and horizontal collision.
- 47 can stand on and be pushed by these particles.
- The main use for these particles is gaining height, whether it is a small or a large amount.
- The more amount of particles a (Breakable Object) has the higher you get from boosting off that (Breakable Object).
- For the most amount of height you can walk over the explosion of the breakable object as its breaking.
- If you pass over the (Breakable Object) as its breaking AND get good RNG on the breakable pattern you can get a 'Double boost' off that item and gain extra height again.

### List of Viable Boosting (Breakable Object) Items ordered by Particle Count

- Violin (Most amount, generates the most height and the easiest to stand on)
- Crystal Ball / Stone bust (High amount, never really useful though)
- Muffin / Brick (Moderate amount, best for staircases with normal railings)
- Apple (Least amount, not good for anything but can work)

### General Breakable Object Boosting Tips

- If throwing breakable objects to boost, it may be helpful to fast throw (crouch -> throw to throw faster and save time.

- Aiming with the gun can help a lot navigating out of bounds, as you move with greater precision when aiming a run.

**Note that 47 does not take fall damage in general, but in certain areas of the map, such as over water, you can fall through a kill plane and instantly die.**

## Boosts with No Object Needed (Examples)

**Following boosts are 100% reliable.**

- [Dartmoor Ledge Boost](https://youtu.be/3B6tU5FfuGI?t=43): Hug left when vaulting, you will be able to drop down.

## Breakable Object Boost Examples (no Breaching Charge)

**Generally speaking, most non-breaching charge boosts can be practiced to be highly consistent, and are viable for full game.**

### Chair Boost

### Stair Boost

- [Chongqing Stair Boost](https://youtu.be/dh8IuU2kTho?t=33): Throw breakable brick to get onto stair railings
- [Sgail Stair Boost](https://youtu.be/3LJ_Bffotwg?t=610): Throw muffin to get onto stair railings, use pistol aiming to move precisely after that.
- Additional tips: Throw breakable object about as far away from the side and the width of 47's feet and on the 1st step. If you throw the breakable object on the corner of the step or the edge of the step it may not break. Try to make sure that you get a circle emanating from where the muffin throw reticle is, for most consistency.

## Breakable Object Boost Examples (with Breaching Charge)

Same as regular breakable object boosts, but breaching charge can propel you farther.

**Generally speaking, most breaching charge boosts are highly inconsistent, and are not viable for full game.**

- [Sgail Boost with Breaching Charge and Suitcase](https://youtu.be/LtnYqLLBPvs?t=3): Throw breakable violin onto suitcase, then use breaching charge to propel 47 even higher over ledge
